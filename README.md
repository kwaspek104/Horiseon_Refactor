# Horiseon_Refactor

## Description 

Welcome to the "About Horiseon" web page! All I did was take the base html and css files given to me and consolidate them, so it will be easier for future coders to understand or edit the web page. The original two files were honestly very confusing and filled with redundancies, all of which I consolidated. 

To make the code less confusing to read, I replaced all of the "div classes" with semantic counterparts. This also makes it easier for future coders to edit, as instead of editing each individual class of "search-engine-optimization," "online-reputation-management," and "social-media-marketing," all you have to do is edit "article" in the css file. 

I also fixed a broken link; if you click on any of the three phrases in the upper right corner, you will be linked to the corresponding section in the web page (The "search-engine-optimization" was the broken link, but it works now.) Finally, I added alt attributes to all of the images, for accessibility purposes. 

I added notes to both files of what I exactly changed. If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to e-mail me at kasper.kuzmicki@yahoo.com. Thank you!
